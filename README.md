# Slush-Web-Dev-Technical-Assignment
  Created a small app using PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React and Node) within a timelimit of 12 hours of development.
  The overall idea was to adapt a Todo app to be as closer as possible of Trello functionality.

## Key Learnings:

- Database setup and manipulation
- REST API
- React components and hooks
- Authentication
- Typescript basics
- UI/UX simple concepts

## Technologies

- PostgreSQL 15.3.1 (pgAdmin 4)
- Express 4.18.2
- React 18.2.6
- Node 20.1.0
- Typescript 5.0.4

  And more details about the dependencies at package.json file.

## How to use?
  
   Run `npm install` inside of the repository after cloning.

### Server
  
  Then go inside of the server directory and run `npm run start` 

### Client
  
  Last step, go inside of the client directory and run `npm run start`. 
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
